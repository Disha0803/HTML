        <p style="font-size: 20px;">C is a procedural programming language. 
        It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a 
        system programming language to write operating system.
         The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, 
         simple set of keywords, and clean style, 
         these features make C language suitable for system programming 
         like operating system or compiler development.</p>
        <h1>WHY TO LEARN C PROGRAMMING?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals
             to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working
             in Software Development Domain.I will list down some of the key
             advantages of learning C Programming:

            <p>C is often referred to as the mother of all programming language because
                 it is one of the most popular programming languages. Right from the time,
                  it was developed, C has become the most widely used and
                   preferred programming languages. 
                Most of the compilers and kernels are written in C today.</p>
